CSS

Where does the CCS go?

- In a seperate file. This is to follow "seperation of concerns".

Exception to this...

- Can use inline style for emails ONLY
- In the head only if it's companies like Amazon, above the fold CSS only 


Use a seperate CSS file...

It is best practise to put CSS in its own file and link to it from the <head>!

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">


The following is a RULE...

p {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}

p is the selector, e.g. h1, nav-bar
color is the property, e.g. background, font size
red is the property value
The declarations are the properties : property value
{} is the declaration block
This will style all the p elements with the same properties



CSS is read top to bottom

Therefore what is written above, can be over written by what comes below
- This is called the cascade


Why might we want to link to a serperate CSS file?
- Seperation of concerns

Common Attributes:

Color: we can use words, Hex, RGBa, HSLa, to define a color

Font-family: Fonts are actually files, if we want to use a non-default font we may have to download or add a font into our header
                e.g. google fonts have lots of different fonts and host the font on their server
                We should put our font imports in the head of our HTML

                <link> href="font link" rel="stylesheet">

                When we import fonts, we must remember to specifically choose the weights we are going to use.
                Dont just import everything as it adds stress on the load.

USE THE MDN to research any CSS problems.



Targeting specific elements...

Selecting by relationship:
- To select an element that is the direct descendent of another element use

e.g. PARENT > CHILD

<section>
    <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
</section>

section > p {
    color: red;
}

> = direct child

Only paragraphs that are direct children of a section would be CSS'd


To select an element that is inside of another element without being directly
descended, use parent element

<section>
    <article>
        <p>Hello, Twitch!</>
    </article>
</section>

section p {
    color: red;
}


DIRECT SIBLING

To select an element that is the next sibling in use

<section>
    <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
    <p>Hello, YouTube!</p>
</section>

p + p {
    color: red;
}

In this instance, only the "Hello, YouTube" string will be targeted. It is the 
only p that has a p that comes before it.




IDs and Classes

IDs are ways of selecting distinct elements
Only use ONE id with the same value per document

#IDName

<section>
    <p>Hello, Twitch!</p>
    <p id="zebra">Hello, Youtube!</p>
</section>

#zebra {
    color: red;
}


CLASSES are for selecting multiple elements
Multiple with same value allowed per document

.className

<section>
    <p class="robot">Hello, Twitch!</p>
    <p id="zebra" class="bob">Hello, Youtube!</p>
    <p class="bob">Goodbye, Mixer!</p>
</section>

.bob {
    color: red;
}




Specificity

Tags = 1 point
Classes = 10 points
IDs = 100 points
!important/Inline Style = 1000 points

!important (CSS ONLY)
- Only use this when you can't figure out the CSS on a short deadline,
which you then later go back to fix
